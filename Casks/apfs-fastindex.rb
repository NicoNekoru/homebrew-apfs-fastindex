# Reference cask file for the apfs-fastindex tap.
#
# The canonical copy lives in the NicoNekoru/homebrew-apfs-fastindex
# repo at `Casks/apfs-fastindex.rb` — that's the path Homebrew's
# tap-resolution machinery looks for. This file in the main
# `apfs-fastindex` repo is the **template** the release flow
# regenerates on every `--publish`, alongside the .dmg.
#
# When you cut a release:
#
#   1. `./make-release.sh --publish --tag vX.Y.Z` here.
#   2. Script writes the `.dmg`, computes its SHA-256, and
#      overwrites this file with the right version + sha256.
#   3. Copy the resulting `homebrew/Casks/apfs-fastindex.rb`
#      into the `homebrew-apfs-fastindex` tap repo, commit,
#      push. Users see the update on their next
#      `brew update && brew upgrade --cask apfs-fastindex`.
#
# Users install via:
#
#   brew tap NicoNekoru/apfs-fastindex
#   brew install --cask apfs-fastindex
#
# Homebrew Cask strips the `com.apple.quarantine` xattr from
# downloaded `.app`s automatically, so users skip the
# right-click-→-Open Gatekeeper friction that ad-hoc-signed
# direct downloads otherwise produce.

  # Post-install cleanup. The app is ad-hoc signed (no Developer
  # ID, no notarization). macOS Sonoma 14+ shows the "Apple could
  # not verify [App] is free of malware" dialog on first launch
  # whenever it sees ANY extended attribute residue, not just
  # `com.apple.quarantine`. Brew's default strip targets only
  # `com.apple.quarantine`; clear everything else (provenance,
  # WhereFroms, etc.) so the first launch goes through cleanly.
  #
  # `-cr` clears all xattrs recursively. We do this against the
  # installed `.app` (whichever `appdir` resolves to — typically
  # `/Applications`) and every nested helper, which is where
  # Sparkle.framework's XPC services + Updater.app live.

  # First-launch caveats. Even with all xattrs cleared, macOS
  # 14.0+ may still pop the verification dialog on the very
  # first launch. The user has to either:
  #   - right-click the app, pick Open, then click Open again
  #     in the confirmation sheet, or
  #   - go to Settings > Privacy & Security and click "Open
  #     Anyway" on the warning shown there.
  # Either path is one-time per install.
  caveats <<~EOS
    apfs-fastindex is ad-hoc signed (no Developer ID). On first
    launch macOS may show:

        "Apple could not verify apfs-fastindex is free of malware"

    Right-click the app in /Applications and pick Open, then
    click Open again to confirm. Subsequent launches go through
    without the prompt. This is a one-time step per install.

    If you'd prefer the no-prompt experience, a notarized build
    requires the maintainer to enroll in the Apple Developer
    Program ($99/yr). See the project README for the current
    plan.
